# **VS Code snippets**

## **Description**

There you can find the snippets I use in my VS Code config

Enjoy :)

## **Installation**

You just have to download the JSON files and add them to your VS Code configuration

## **Potential Errors**

While there aren't referenced as snippets, VS Code will treat them as JSON files with errors, because they are documented. But there is no problem :)
